    "description": "<p>*Please note: most attendees tend not to RSVP to this meetup, so numbers may be misleading - feel free to drop by even if you haven't RSVPd! (do RSVP if you are planning on coming though, as we may postpone or finish early if we're expecting a small turnout)*</p> <p>A general space for anybody interested in open technologies (open source, open data or otherwise), to catch up and relax after work on Friday fortnights. People of all backgrounds, interests, skillsets and disciplines welcome.</p> <p>The Open Industry concept itself is about the ability of microentities and small businesses to collaborate formally on projects large and small, facilitated by open technologies - so we are combining the twin aims of:</p> <p>- giving tech freelancers, contractors and indies of all walks of technology life a focal point for an end-of-week (we need one too...), and</p> <p>- helping independents (and those considering a future step out) to link up to get sustainable open projects off the ground.</p>",
