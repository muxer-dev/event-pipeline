    "meetup, so numbers may be misleading - feel free to drop by "
    "even if you haven't RSVPd! (do RSVP if you are planning on "
    "coming though, as we may postpone or finish early if we're "
    "expecting a small turnout)*</p> <p>A general space for "
    "anybody interested in open technologies (open source, open "
    "data or otherwise), to catch up and relax after work on "
    "Friday fortnights. People of all backgrounds, interests, "
    "skillsets and disciplines welcome.</p> <p>The Open Industry "
    "concept itself is about the ability of microentities and "
    "small businesses to collaborate formally on projects large "
    "and small, facilitated by open technologies - so we are "
    "combining the twin aims of:</p> <p>- giving tech freelancers, "
    "contractors and indies of all walks of technology life a "
    "focal point for an end-of-week (we need one too...), and</p> "
    "<p>- helping independents (and those considering a future "
    "step out) to link up to get sustainable open projects off the "
    "ground.</p>",
